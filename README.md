# Nova Scotia Open Data

Nova Scotia's government has an abundance of resources in terms of data and information. All this data has been collected and stored on the NSOD portal (https://data.novascotia.ca)  in the form of datasets. The Nova Scotia Open Data Portal was built and managed by Socrata API (https://dev.socrata.com). The main purpose of this web portal is to allow the datasets to be widely used for individuals, particularly Nova Scotians, to have easier access to the information, understand their government, support their businesses, gain new insights and make discoveries.

We transformed the disease related datasets of Nova Scotia Open Data into RDF and it is available to be used under MIT licence.
